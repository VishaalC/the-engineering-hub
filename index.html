                <p>In mathematics, the Taylor series of a function is an infinite sum of terms that are expressed in terms of the function's derivatives at a single point. For most common functions, the function and the sum of its Taylor series are equal near this point. Taylor series are named after Brook Taylor, who introduced them in 1715. If 0 is the point where the derivatives are considered, a Taylor series is also called a Maclaurin series, after Colin Maclaurin, who made extensive use of this special case of Taylor series in the mid 1700s.</p>

                <p>The Taylor series of a real or complex-valued function f (x) that is infinitely differentiable at a real or complex number a is the power series</p>

                <p>where f(n)(a) denotes the nth derivative of f evaluated at the point a.<br>When a = 0, the series is also called a Maclaurin series.</p>

                <p> In other words, it is a series that is used to create an estimate (guess) of what a function looks like. It is used in  computer science, calculus, chemistry, physics and other kinds of higher-level mathematics.</p>

                <h2>Readability Calculator:</h2><br>
                <p>A readability index is an estimation of how difficult a text is to read. The estimation is made by measuring a text's complexity. Measurable attributes of texts such as word lengths, sentence lengths, syllable counts, and so on give us ways to measure the complexity of a text. Text complexity is then compared to how well readers comprehend the text. From this data, a formula is created which predicts a text's reading difficulty from its complexity.</p><br>
                <h3>Why is readability important?</h3>
                <p>Aiming for high readability improves the likelihood that the reader will clearly understand your thoughts and ideas. High readability lessens misunderstanding and lets the reader easily process the information that you've shared without expending a lot of energy.</p>
                <p>Publishers also use readability to determine which demographic to advertise to.</p><br>
                <h3>The Coleman-liau Index:</h3>
                <p>The Coleman–Liau index is a readability test designed by Meri Coleman and T. L. Liau to gauge the understandability of a text. Like the Flesch–Kincaid Grade Level, Gunning fog index, SMOG index, and Automated Readability Index, its output approximates the U.S. grade level thought necessary to comprehend the text.</p>
                <p>The Coleman–Liau index is calculated with the following formula:</p>
                <img src="images/3.svg">
                <p>L is the average number of letters per 100 words and S is the average number of sentences per 100 words.</p><br>
